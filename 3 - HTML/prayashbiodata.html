    <img src="a.jpg" alt="prayash's photo" height="300px">
    <p>Hello everyone, its me Prayash Koirala. I am currently residing in the beautiful land-locked nation of Nepal.
        I have completed a 4 year degree in Geomatics Engineering. Currently, I am recovering from an illness called Chrons disease.
        Since I am unable to work on field due to my predicament, I am trying to switch my career to a more remote based job. Therefore I 
        am learning web development to further my career prospects in the remote job market. I am currently using the following resources to 
        learn web development:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One Code Camp</li>
            <li>100devs training program</li>
            <li>CS50x</li>
            <li>CS50 Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Besides programming, I have several hobbies to keep me occupied throughout the week. In no particular order, and short description they are as follows:</p>
        <dl>
